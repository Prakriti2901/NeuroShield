Stroke is a medical emergency and prompt treatment is crucial for minimizing brain damage and potential complications.**

            - Exercise regularly: Engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 150 minutes per week.  
            - Quit smoking: Smoking increases your risk of stroke; quitting lowers it.  
            - Limit alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and increase stroke risk.
